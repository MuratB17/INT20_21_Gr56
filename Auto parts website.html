<h1>What are the parts of a car</h1>
<h>The Steering Wheel is Connected to the...</h>
<p>
    
<br>From the steering system to the front and rear suspension, a gas-powered vehicle is filled
 with a host of parts that come together to power your car, truck or SUV down the road. While it may feel like a foreign language,
  having a working understanding of how the steering and suspension systems relate to the other parts of your vehicle
   is extremely helpful in visualizing how your vehicle functions.</br>
</p>
<h1>Putting it all Together</h1>
<img src="car-parts-diagram.jpg" width="660" height="400">
<ol>
    <li>Engine
       <br> The heart and soul of your vehicle is the internal combustion engine. 
       The engine block features parts such as the timing chain, camshaft, crankshaft, spark plugs, cylinder heads, valves and pistons.</br>
    <li>Transmission
        <br>The transmission is a gearbox filled with gears and gear trains that makes effective use
         of the engine’s torque to change the gears and power the vehicle.</br></li>
    <li>Battery
        <br>The battery delivers the electricity needed to run your vehicle’s electrical components.
         Without a battery, your car won’t run.</br>
        
        </li>
        <li>
            Alternator
<br>Part of the electrical system, the alternator charges the battery and powers the electrical system while your car is running.
        </br> </li>
        <li>Radiator
         <br>   The radiator is responsible for helping the engine keep cool by removing heat from coolant before 
         it is pumped back through the engine.</br></li>
<li>
    Front Axle
<br>Part of the suspension system, the front axle is where the front wheel hubs are attached.</br>
</li>
<li>
    Front Steering and Suspension
<br>Helps improve the ride and handling of the vehicle. Though systems vary in makeup, they typically include shocks/struts,
 ball joints, tie rod ends, rack and pinion steering system and idler/pitman arms.</br>
</li>
        
        <img src="car-parts-diagram-back.jpg" width="660" height="400">
        
            <li>
                Brakes
<br>Found on all four wheels, your brakes are one of the most important safety systems on your vehicle. 
Disc brakes can be found on the front and back wheels and feature brake pads and calipers. 
Drum brakes with brake shoes and wheel cylinders may be found on the back wheels of some vehicles.</br>
            </li>
            <li>
                Catalytic Converter
<br>A device that controls emissions from your vehicle, the catalytic converter transforms harmful gases and pollutants into less harmful 
emissions before they leave the car’s exhaust system.</br>
            </li>
            <li>
                Muffler
<br>Keeps the exhaust system quiet through the use of baffles or other materials that reduce or muffle the sound.</br>


            </li>
            <li>
                Tailpipe
<br>Carries exhaust fumes from the muffler to outside of the vehicle.</br>
            </li>
            <li>
                Fuel Tank
<br>Typically located before the rear axle, the fuel tank holds the gasoline that powers your vehicle.
 The placement is important to avoid areas that could crumple in a crash.</br>
            </li>
            <li>
                Rear Axle
<br>Key part of the suspension system to which the rear wheels are mounted.</br>

            </li>
            <li>
                Rear Suspension
<br>As with the front suspension, the rear suspension contributes to the handling and ride quality of the vehicle. 
Systems can vary, but they usually are made up of shocks, coil springs, ball joints, control arms and CV joints.</br>
            </li>
        </ol>
